High-level and low-level programming refer to the level of abstraction. C is a middle-level language. Variables are like water in a cupâ€”before use, they must be initialized. Unlike constants, variables can change over time. Multiple variables can be initialized in one line (e.g., int var1, var2, var3). Avoid long variable names and unnecessary spaces.
